# victorlyapp
Victoryapp is a fullstack NFTs Marketplace developed for Victor.ly (https://www.victor.ly/), an educational consulting platform for student-athletes with 2100 + registered users. 
Victor.ly was selected from 10+ final round teams to win the Innovation Sport Award from Hype Spin accelerator Taiwan and the Sports Administration of Taiwan. 

The NFTs Marketplace contains three major sections: Backend, Frontend, and NFT contracts. 
- Backend-Express: the backend server was developed through Express.js with Internal API deployed on Heroku. 
- Frontend: the frontend NFT marketplace was developed with React.js and web3.js with integrated OpenSea SDK using JavaScript. 
- Contracts: NFTs contracts were created with ERC 721 standard supported by Openzeppelin, supported by the Truffle.js  development environment.


The project has two versions, branch main and Jul-19, with different implementations of OpenSeaSDK. The final version is integrated into the Victor.ly Github.
